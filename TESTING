SUMMARY
Therapy development for adult diffuse glioma is hindered by incomplete knowledge of somatic glioma
driving alterations and suboptimal disease classification. We defined the complete set of genes associated with 1,122 diffuse grade II-III-IV gliomas from
The Cancer Genome Atlas and used molecular
profiles to improve disease classification, identify
molecular correlations, and provide insights into
the progression from low- to high-grade disease.
Whole-genome sequencing data analysis determined that ATRX but not TERT promoter mutations
are associated with increased telomere length.
Recent advances in glioma classification based on
IDH mutation and 1p/19q co-deletion status were
recapitulated through analysis of DNA methylation
profiles, which identified clinically relevant molecular
subsets. A subtype of IDH mutant glioma was associated with DNA demethylation and poor outcome;

a group of IDH-wild-type diffuse glioma showed molecular similarity to pilocytic astrocytoma and relatively favorable survival. Understanding of cohesive
disease groups may aid improved clinical outcomes.
INTRODUCTION
Diffuse gliomas represent 80% of malignant brain tumors
(Schwartzbaum et al., 2006). Adult diffuse gliomas are classified and graded according to histological criteria (oligodendroglioma, oligoastrocytoma, astrocytoma, and glioblastoma;
grade II to IV). Although histopathologic classification is well
established and is the basis of the World Health Organization
(WHO) classification of CNS tumors (Louis et al., 2007), it suffers from high intra- and inter-observer variability, particularly
among grade II-III tumors (van den Bent, 2010). Recent molecular characterization studies have benefited from the availability of the datasets generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) (Brennan et al., 2013; Eckel-Passow et al., 2015; Frattini et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2015; Suzuki et al., 2015; Cancer
Genome Atlas Research Network et al., 2015) and have related
genetic, gene expression, and DNA methylation signatures
with prognosis (Noushmehr et al., 2010; Sturm et al., 2012;
Verhaak et al., 2010). For example, mutations in the isocitrate
dehydrogenase genes 1 and 2 (IDH1/IDH2) define a distinct
subset of glioblastoma (GBM) with a hypermethylation phenotype (G-CIMP) with favorable outcome (Noushmehr et al.,
2010; Yan et al., 2009). Conversely, the absence of IDH mutations in LGG marks a distinct IDH-wild-type subgroup characterized by poor, GBM-like prognosis (Eckel-Passow et al.,
2015; Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al., 2015).
Recent work by us and others has proposed classification of
glioma into IDH wild-type cases, IDH mutant group additionally carrying codeletion of chromosome arm 1p and 19q
(IDH mutant-codel) and samples with euploid 1p/19q (IDH
mutant-non-codel), regardless of grade and histology (EckelPassow et al., 2015; Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network
et al., 2015). Mutation of the TERT promoter, which has been
reported with high frequency across glioma, may be an additional defining feature. Current analyses have not yet clarified
the relationships between LGGs and GBMs that share common genetic hallmarks like IDH mutation or TERT promoter
mutation status. An improved understanding of these relationships will be necessary as we evolve toward an objective
genome-based clinical classification.
To address the above issues, we assembled a dataset
comprising all TCGA newly diagnosed diffuse glioma consisting
of 1,122 patients and comprehensively analyzed using sequencing and array-based molecular profiling approaches. We
have addressed crucial technical challenges in analyzing this
comprehensive dataset, including the integration of multiple
platforms and data sources (e.g., multiple methylation and
gene expression platforms). We identified new diffuse glioma
subgroups with distinct molecular and clinical features and
shed light on the mechanisms driving progression of lower grade
glioma (LGG) (WHO grades II and III) into full-blown GBM (WHO
grade IV).
RESULTS
Patient Cohort Characteristics
The TCGA LGG and GBM cohorts consist of 516 and 606 patients, respectively. Independent analysis of the GBM dataset
was previously described, as was analysis of 290 LGG samples
(Brennan et al., 2013; Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network
et al., 2015). 226 LGG samples were added to our current cohort
(Table 1). Clinical data, including age, tumor grade, tumor histology, and survival, were available for 93% (1,046/1,122) of cases
(Table S1). The majority of samples were grade IV tumors (n =
590, 56%), whereas 216 (21%) and 241 (23%) were grade II
and III tumors, respectively. Similarly, 590 (56%) samples were
classified as GBM, 174 (17%) as oligodendroglioma, 169
(16%) as astrocytoma, and 114 (11%) as oligoastrocytoma.
Among the data sources considered in our analysis were gene
expression (n = 1,045), DNA copy number (n = 1,084), DNA
methylation (n = 932), exome sequencing (n = 820), and protein
expression (n = 473). Multiple and overlapping characterization
assays were employed (Table S1). All data files that were used
in our analysis can be found at https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/
docs/publications/lgggbm_2015/.
Identification of Novel Glioma-Associated Genomic
Alterations
To establish the set of genomic alterations that drive gliomagenesis, we called point mutations and indels on the exomes of 513
LGG and 307 GBM using the Mutect, Indelocator, Varscan2,
and RADIA algorithms and considered all mutations identified
by at least two callers. Significantly mutated genes (SMGs)
were determined using MutSigCV. This led to the identification
of 75 SMGs, 10 of which had been previously reported in
GBM (Brennan et al., 2013), 12 of which had been reported in
LGG (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al., 2015),
and 8 of which had been identified in both GBM and LGG
studies. 45 SMGs have not been previously associated with
glioma and ranged in mutation frequency from 0.5% to 2.6%
(Table S2A). We used GISTIC2 to analyze the DNA copy number
profiles of 1,084 samples, including 513 LGG and 571 GBM,
and identified 162 significantly altered DNA copy number segments (Table S2B). We employed PRADA and deFuse to detect
1,144 gene fusion events in the RNA-seq profiles available for
154 GBM and 513 LGG samples, of which 37 in-frame fusions
involved receptor tyrosine kinases (Table S2C). Collectively,
these analyses recovered all known glioma driving events,
including in IDH1 (n = 457), TP53 (n = 328), ATRX (n = 220),
EGFR (n = 314), PTEN (n = 168), CIC (n = 80), and FUBP1
(n = 45). Notable newly predicted glioma drivers relative to the
earlier TCGA analyses were genes associated with chromatin
organization such as SETD2 (n = 24), ARID2 (n = 20), DNMT3A
(n = 11), and the KRAS/NRAS oncogenes (n = 25 and n = 5,
respectively).
We overlapped copy number, mutation (n = 793), and fusion
transcript (n = 649) profiles and confirmed the convergence of
genetic drivers of glioma into pathways, including the Ras-RafMEK-ERK, p53/apoptosis, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, chromatin modification, and cell cycle pathways. The Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling cascade showed alterations in 106 of 119 members
Cell 164, 550–563, January 28, 2016 ª2016 Elsevier Inc. 551
detected across 578 cases (73%), mostly occurring in IDH-wildtype samples (n = 327 of 357, 92%). Conversely, we found that a
set of 36 genes involved in chromatin modification was targeted
by genetic alterations in 423 tumors (54%, n = 36 genes), most of
which belonged to the IDH mutant-non-codel group (n = 230,
87%).
In order to identify new somatically altered glioma genes, we
used MutComFocal to nominate candidates altered by mutation,
as well as copy number alteration. Prominent among these
genes was NIPBL, a crucial adherin subunit that is essential for
loading cohesins on chromatin (Table S2D) (Peters and Nishiyama, 2012). The cohesin complex is responsible for the adhesion of sister chromatids following DNA replication and is essential to prevent premature chromatid separation and faithful
chromosome segregation during mitosis (Peters and Nishiyama,
2012). Alterations in the cohesin pathway have been reported in
12% of acute myeloid leukemias (Kon et al., 2013). Mutations of
the cohesin complex gene STAG2 had been previously reported
in GBM (Brennan et al., 2013). Taken together, 16% of the LGG/
GBM showed mutations and/or CNAs in multiple genes involved
in the cohesin complex, thus nominating this process as a prominent pathway involved in gliomagenesis.

Telomere Length Is Positively Correlated with ATRX, but
Not TERT Promoter Mutations
Mutations in the TERT promoter (TERTp) have been reported in
80% of GBM (Killela et al., 2013). We used TERTp mutation
calls from targeted sequencing (n = 287) and complemented
them with TERTp mutations inferred from whole-genome
sequencing (WGS) data (n = 42). TERTp mutations are nearly
mutually exclusive with mutations in ATRX (Eckel-Passow
et al., 2015), which was confirmed in our cohort. Overall,
85% of diffuse gliomas harbored mutations of TERTp (n =
157, 48%) or ATRX (n = 120, 37%). TERTp mutations activate
TERT mRNA expression through the creation of a de novo
E26 transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factor-binding
site (Horn et al., 2013), and we observed significant TERT
upregulation in TERTp mutant cases (p value < 0.0001, Figure S1A). TERT expression measured by RNA-seq was a highly
sensitive (91%) and specific (95%) surrogate for the presence
of TERTp mutation (Figure S1B). We correlated TERTp status
with glioma driving alterations and observed that nearly all
IDH-wild-type cases with chromosome 7 gain and chromosome 10 loss harbored TERTp mutations or upregulated
TERT expression (n = 52/53 and n = 134/147, respectively; Figure 1A). Conversely, only 45% of IDH-wild-type samples lacking chromosome 7/chromosome 10 events showed TERTp
mutations or elevated TERT expression (n = 15/33 and n =
43/82, respectively). Thus, TERTp mutations may precede the
chr 7/chr 10 alterations that have been implicated in glioma
initiation (Ozawa et al., 2014).

double negative (n = 13, 11%) status. *** = p <
0.0001; ** = p < 0.001.
To correlate TERTp mutations to telomere length, we used whole-genome
sequencing and low pass whole-genome
sequencing data to estimate telomere
length in 141 pairs of matched tumor
and normal samples. As expected, we
observed an inverse correlation of telomere length with age at diagnosis in
matching blood normal samples (Figure 1B) and tumor samples (Figure S1C).
Glioma samples harboring ATRX mutations showed significantly longer telomeres compared to TERTp mutant samples (t test p value < 0.0001; Figure 1C).
Among TERTp mutation gliomas, there
was no difference in telomere length between samples with and
without additional IDH1/IDH2 mutations, despite a difference in
age. ATRX forms a complex with DAXX and H3.3, and the genes
encoding these proteins are frequently mutated in pediatric gliomas (Sturm et al., 2012). Mutations in DAXX and H3F3A were
identified in only two samples in our WGS dataset. The ATRXDAXX-H3.3 complex is associated with the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) and our observations confirm previously
hypothesized fundamental differences between the telomere
control exerted by telomerase and ALT (Sturm et al., 2014).
As demonstrated by the identification of TERTp mutations, somatic variants affecting regulatory regions may play a role in gliomagenesis. Using 67 matched whole-genome and RNA-seq
expression pairs, we similarly sought to identify mutations
located within 2 kb upstream of transcription start sites and
associated with a gene expression change. Using strict filtering
methods, we identified 12 promoter regions with mutations in
at least 6 samples. Three of 12 regions related to a significant
difference in the expression of the associated gene expression,
suggesting possible functional consequences. Other than TERT
(n = 37), promoter mutations of the ubiquitin ligase TRIM28 (n = 8)
and the calcium channel gamma subunit CACNG6 (n = 7) correlated with respectively upregulation and downregulation of these
genes, respectively (Table S2E). TRIM28 has been reported to
mediate the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) leading to activation of mTOR signaling
and hypersensitization to AMPK agonists, such as metformin
(Pineda et al., 2015).

Unsupervised Clustering of Gliomas Identifies Six
Methylation Groups and Four RNA Expression Groups
Associated with IDH Status
To segregate the DNA methylation subtypes across the pan-glioma dataset, we analyzed 932 glioma samples profiled on the
HumanMethylation450 platform (516 LGG and 129 GBM) and
the HumanMethylation27 platform (287 GBM). In order to incorporate the maximum number of samples, we merged datasets
from both methylation platforms yielding a core set of 25,978
CpG probes. To reduce computational requirements to cluster
this large dataset, we eliminated sites that were methylated
(mean b value R 0.3) in non-tumor brain tissues and selected
1,300 tumor-specific methylated probes (1,300/25,978, 5%) to
perform unsupervised k-means consensus clustering. This identified six distinct clusters, labeled LGm1–6 (Figure 2A and Tables
S1 and S3A). Next, we sought to determine pan-glioma expression subtypes through unsupervised clustering analysis of 667
RNA-seq profiles (513 LGG and 154 GBM), which resulted in
four main clusters labeled LGr1–4 (Figure 2B and Tables S1
and S3A). An additional 378 GBM samples with Affymetrix HTHG-U133A profiles (but lacking RNA-seq data) were classified
into the four clusters using a k-nearest neighbor classification
procedure. IDH mutation status was the primary driver of methylome and transcriptome clustering and separated the cohort
into two macro-groups. The LGm1/LGm2/LGm3 DNA methylation macro-group carried IDH1 or IDH2 mutations (449 of 450,
99%) and was enriched for LGG (421/454, 93%) while LGm4/
LGm5/LGm6 were IDH-wild-type (429/430, 99%) and enriched
for GBM (383/478, 80%). LGm1–3 showed genome-wide hypermethylation compared to LGm4–6 clusters (Figure S2A), documenting the association between IDH mutation and increased
DNA methylation (Noushmehr et al., 2010; Turcan et al., 2012).
Principal component analysis using 19,520 probes yielded
similar results, thus emphasizing that our probe selection
method did not introduce unwanted bias (Figure S2B). The
gene expression clusters LGr1–3 harbored IDH1 or IDH2 mutations (438 of 533, 82%) and were enriched for LGG (436/563,
77%), while the LGr4 was exclusively IDH-wild-type (376 of
387, 97%) and enriched for GBM (399/476, 84%).
We extended our analysis using Tumor Map (Supplemental
Experimental Procedures) to perform integrated co-clustering
analysis of the combined gene expression (n = 1,196) and DNA
methylation (n = 867) profiles. An interactive Tumor Map version
is publicly available at http://tumormap.ucsc.edu/?p=ynewton.
gliomas-paper. Tumor Map assigns samples to a hexagon in a
grid so that nearby samples are likely to have similar genomic
profiles and allows visualizing complex relationships between
heterogeneous genomic data samples and their clinical or
phenotypical associations. Thus, clusters in the map indicate
groups of samples with high similarity of integrated gene expression and DNA methylation profiles (Figure 2C). The map confirms
clustering by IDH status and additionally shows islands of samples that share previously reported GBM cluster memberships
(Noushmehr et al., 2010; Verhaak et al., 2010). To assess

clustering sensitivity to pre-processing, we tried complementary
methods and obtained similar results (Figure S2C).
To identify genes whose copy number changes are associated
with concordant changes in gene expression, we combined
expression and copy number profiles from 659 samples to define
a signature of 57 genes with strong functional copy number (fCN)
change (Table S3B). The fCN signature clustered gliomas into
three macro-clusters, LGfc1–3, strongly associated with IDH
and 1p/19q status (Figure S2D). The fCN analysis revealed the
functional activation of a cluster of HOXA genes in the IDHwild-type LGfc2 cluster, which were previously associated with
glioma stem cell maintenance (Kurscheid et al., 2015).
Finally, we clustered reverse phase protein array profiles, consisting of 196 antibodies on 473 samples. Two macro clusters
were observed, and in contrast to the transcriptome/methylome/fCNV clustering, the primary discriminator was based on
glioma grade (LGG versus GBM) rather than IDH status (Figure S2E). Compared to the LGG-like cluster, the GBM-like
cluster had elevated expression of IGFBP2, fibronectin, PAI1,
HSP70, EGFR, phosphoEGFR, phosphoAKT, Cyclin B1, Caveolin, Collagen VI, Annexin1, and ASNS, whereas the LGG class
showed increased activity of PKC (alpha, beta, and delta),
PTEN, BRAF, and phosphoP70S6K.
The above results confirm IDH status as the major determinant
of the molecular footprints of diffuse glioma. To further elucidate
the subtypes of diffuse glioma, we performed unsupervised clustering within each of the two IDH-driven macroclusters. We used
1,308 tumor-specific CpG probes defined among the IDH mutation cohort (n = 450) and identified three IDH mutant-specific
DNA methylation clusters (Figure S3A). Using 914 tumor-specific
CpG probes in the IDH-wild-type cohort (n = 430), we uncovered
three IDH-wild-type-specific clusters (Figure S4A). The sets of
CpG probes used to cluster each of the two IDH-driven datasets
overlapped significantly with the 1,300 probes that defined the
pan-glioma DNA methylation clustering (1162/1,300, 89% and
853/1,300, 66%, for IDH mutant and IDH-wild-type, respectively). The clusters identified by separating IDH mutant and
IDH-wild-type gliomas showed strong overall concordance
with pan-glioma DNA methylation subtypes (Table S3A). Similarly, unsupervised clustering of 426 IDH mutant RNA-seq profiles resulted in three subtypes (Figure S3A), and analysis of
the 234 IDH-wild-type samples led to four mixed LGG/GBM
clusters that showed enrichment for previously identified GBM
expression subtypes (Figure S4C) (Verhaak et al., 2010).
An Epigenetic Signature Associated with Activation of
Cell Cycle Genes Segregates a Subgroup of IDH Mutant
LGG and GBM with Unfavorable Clinical Outcome
The three epigenetic subtypes defined by clustering IDH mutant
glioma separated samples harboring the 1p/19q co-deletion into
a single cluster and non-codel glioma into two clusters (Figure S3A). Conversely, non-codel glioma grouped nearly exclusively into a single expression cluster, and codels were split in
two separated expression clusters (Figure S3A). A distinct subgroup of samples within the IDH mutant-non-codel DNA methylation clusters manifested relatively reduced DNA methylation
(Figure S3B). The unsupervised clustering of IDH mutant glioma
was unable to segregate the lower methylated non-codel subgroup as the 1,308 probes selected for unsupervised clustering
included only 19 of the 131 differentially methylated probes characteristic for this subgroup (FDR < 1015, difference in mean
methylation beta value > 0.27). The low-methylation subgroup
consisted of both G-CIMP GBM (13/25) and LGGs (12/25) and
was confirmed using a non-TCGA dataset (Figure S3C). The tumors with higher methylation in the split cluster were very similar
to those grouped in the second non-codel cluster, and a supervised comparison identified only 12 probes as differentially DNA
methylated (Figures 3A and 3B). We concluded that IDH mutant
glioma is composed of three coherent subgroups: (1) the Codel
group, consisting of IDH mutant-codel LGGs; (2) the G-CIMPlow group, including IDH mutant-non-codel glioma (LGG and
GBM) manifesting relatively low genome-wide DNA methylation;
and (3) the G-CIMP-high group, including IDH mutant-non-codel
glioma (LGG and GBM) with higher global levels of DNA methylation. The newly identified G-CIMP-low group of glioma was
associated with significantly worse survival as compared to the
G-CIMP-high and Codel groups (Figure S3D). The clinical
outcome of the tumors classified as G-CIMP-high was as favorable as that of Codel tumors, the subgroup generally thought to
have the best prognosis among glioma patients (Figures 3C and
S3D). We compared the frequencies of glioma driver gene alterations between the three types of IDH mutant glioma and found
that 15 of 18 G-CIMP-low cases carried abnormalities in cell
cycle pathway genes such as CDK4 and CDKN2A, relative to
36/241 and 2/172 for G-CIMP-high and Codels, respectively
(Figure 3D). Supervised analysis between gene expression of
G-CIMP-low and G-CIMP-high resulted in 943 differentially expressed genes. We mapped the 943 deregulated genes to 767
nearest CpG probes (max distance 1 kb) and found the majority

of the CpG probes (486/767, 63%) to show a significant methylation difference (FDR < 0.05, difference in mean methylation beta
value > 0.01) between G-CIMP-low and G-CIMP-high, suggesting a mechanistic relation between loss of methylation and
increased transcript levels.
Recent analysis of epigenetic profiles derived from colon cancers showed that transcription factors may bind to regions
of demethylated DNA (Berman et al., 2012). Therefore, we
asked whether transcription factors may be recruited to the
DNA regions differentially methylated between G-CIMP-low
samples and G-CIMP-high samples from the same methylation
cluster, using 450K methylation profiles (n = 39). Globally, we
detected 643 differentially methylated probes between 27
G-CIMP-low and 12 G-CIMP-high samples (absolute diff-mean
difference R 0.25, FDR % 5%). Most of these probes (69%)
were located outside of any known CpG island but positioned
within intergenic regions known as open seas (Figure 3E). This
represents a 2.5-fold open sea enrichment compared to the
expected genome-wide distribution of 450K CpG probes (chisquare p value < 2.2 3 1016). We also observed a 3.4-fold
depletion within CpG islands (chi-square p value < 2.2 3 1016).
Using this set of intergenic CpG probes, we asked whether a
DNA motif signature associated with distal regulatory elements.
Such a pattern would point to candidate transcription factors
involved in tumorigenesis of the G-CIMP-low group. A de novo
motif scan and known motif scan identified a distinct motif signature TGTT (geometric test p value = 1011, fold enrichment = 1.8),
known to be associated with the OLIG2 and SOX transcription
factor families (Figure 3E) (Lodato et al., 2013). This observation
was corroborated by the higher expression levels of SOX2, as
well as 17 out of 20 other known SOX family members in GCIMP-low compared to G-CIMP-high (fold difference > 2). The
primary function of SOX2 in the nervous system is to promote
self-renewal of neural stem cells and, within brain tumors, the glioma stem cell state (Graham et al., 2003). Interestingly, SOX2
and OLIG2 have been described as neurodevelopmental transcription factors being essential for GBM propagation (Suva`
et al., 2014). Supervised gene expression pathway analysis of
the genes activated in the G-CIMP-low group as opposed to
G-CIMP-high group revealed activation of genes involved in
cell cycle and cell division consistent with the role of SOX in promoting cell proliferation (Figure S3E). The enrichment in cell cycle gene expression provides additional support to the notion
that development of the G-CIMP-low subtype is associated
with activation of cell cycle progression and may be mediated
by a loss of CpG methylation and binding of SOX factors to
candidate genomic enhancer elements.
To validate the G-CIMP-low, G-CIMP-high, and Codel IDH
mutant subtypes, we compiled a validation cohort from published studies, including 324 adult and pediatric gliomas
(Lambert et al., 2013; Mur et al., 2013; Sturm et al., 2012; Turcan
et al., 2012). The CpG probe methylation signatures used to classify the validation set are provided on the publication portal
accompanying this publication (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/
docs/publications/lgggbm_2015/). Among them, 103 were identified as IDH mutant on the basis of their genome-wide DNA
methylation profile. We classified samples in the validation set
using the probes that defined the IDH mutant-specific DNA
methylation cluster analysis integrated in a supervised random
forest method. The analysis recapitulated the clusters generated
from the TCGA collection (Figure S3C). In order to determine
epigenetically regulated (EReg) genes that may be characteristic
of the biology of the IDH mutant diffuse glioma subtypes, we
compared 450k methylation DNA methylation profiles and
gene expression levels between 636 IDH mutant and IDH-wildtype gliomas and 110 non-tumor samples from 11 different
tissue types. From the list of epigenetically regulated genes,
we extracted 263 genes that were grouped into EReg gene signatures, which showed differential signals among the three
IDH mutant subtypes (Figure 3F). These trends were confirmed
in the validation set (Figure 3G).
We investigated the possibility that the G-CIMP-high group is
a predecessor to the G-CIMP-low group by comparing the DNA
methylation profiles from ten IDH mutant-non-codel LGG
and GBM primary-recurrent cases with the TCGA cohort. We
evaluated the DNA methylation status of probes identified as
differentially methylated (n = 90) between G-CIMP-low and GCIMP-high (FDR < 1013, difference in mean methylation betavalue > 0.3 and < 0.4). Four out of ten IDHmut-non-codel cases
showed a demethylation pattern after disease recurrence, while
partial demethylation was demonstrated in the remaining six recurrences, supporting the notion of a progression from G-CIMPhigh to G-CIMP-low phenotype (Figure 3H).
An IDH-Wild-Type Subgroup of Histologically Defined
Diffuse Glioma Is Associated with Favorable Survival
and Shares Epigenomic and Genomic Features with
Pilocytic Astrocytoma
IDH-wild-type gliomas segregated into three DNA methylation
clusters (Figure S4A). The first is enriched with tumors belonging
to the classical gene expression signature and was labeled
Classic-like, whereas the second group, enriched with mesenchymal subtype tumors, was labeled Mesenchymal-like (Table
S1) (Verhaak et al., 2010). The third cluster contained a larger
fraction of LGG in comparison to the other IDH-wild-type clusters. We observed that the IDH-wild-type LGGs but not the
IDH-wild-type GBM in this cluster displayed markedly longer
survival (log-rank p value = 3.6 3 105; Figure 4A) and occurred
in younger patients (mean 37.6 years versus 50.8 years, t test p
value = 0.002). Supervised analysis of differential methylation
between LGG and GBM in the third DNA methylation cluster
did not reveal any significant probes despite significant differences in stromal content (p value < 0.005; Figure S4D), suggesting that this group cannot be further separated using CpG
methylation markers.
Next, we sought to validate the methylation-based classification of IDH-wild-type glioma in an independent cohort of 221
predicted IDH-wild-type glioma samples, including 61 grade I pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs). Toward this aim, we used a supervised random forest model built with the probes that defined
the IDH-wild-type clusters. Samples classified as Mesenchymal-like showed enrichment for the Sturm et al. (2012)
Mesenchymal subtype (29/88), and gliomas predicted as
Classic-like were all RTK II ‘‘Classic’’ (22/22), per the Sturm
et al. (2012) classification (Figures 4B and S4B). We observed
that PA tumors were unanimously classified as the third,
Cell 164, 550–563, January 28, 2016 ª2016 Elsevier Inc. 557
LGG-enriched group (Figure S4B). Based on the molecular similarity with PA, we labeled the LGGs in the third methylation cluster of IDH-wild-type tumors as PA-like. The GBMs in this group
were best described as LGm6-GBM for their original pan-glioma
methylation cluster assignment and tumor grade.
Pilocytic astrocytomas are characterized by frequent alterations in the MAPK pathway, such as FGFR1 mutations,
KIAA1549-BRAF, and NTRK2 fusions (Jones et al., 2013). The
frequency of mutations, fusions, and amplifications in eight
PA-associated genes (BRAF, NF1, NTRK1, NTRK2, FGFR1,
and FGFR2) rated from 11% (n = 12/113) of Classic-like, 13%
(n = 21/158) of Mesenchymal-like IDH-wild-type tumors to
32% (n = 7/22) of LGm6-GBM and 52% (n = 13/25) of PA-like
LGG (Fisher’s exact test [FET] p value < 0.0001; Figure 4C).
Conversely, only 2 of 25 (8%) PA-like LGG tumors showed
TERT expression, compared to 5 of 12 LGm6-GBM (43%), 60
of 65 Classic-like (92%), and 82 of 98 Mesenchymal-like (84%,
FET p value < 0.0001). The PA-like group was characterized by
relatively low frequency of typical GBM alterations in genes
such as EGFR, CDKN2A/B, and PTEN and displayed euploid
DNA copy number profiles (Figure S4E). To ascertain that the
histologies of the PA-like subgroup had been appropriately
classified, we conducted an independent re-review. This analysis confirmed the presence of the histologic features of diffuse
glioma (grade II or grade III) in 23 of the 26 cases in the cluster.
The remaining three cases were re-named as PA (grade I). An
independent review of the magnetic resonance diagnostic
images from 13 cases showed a similar pattern, with the majority of tumors showing behavior consistent with grade II or
grade III glioma. Taken together, the epigenetic analysis of the

IDH-wild-type group of adult glioma revealed the existence of a
novel subgroup sharing genetic and DNA methylation features
with pediatric PA and favorable clinical outcome compared to
diffuse IDH-wild-type glioma. This group may include but extends beyond BRAF-mutated grade II oligodendroglioma that
were previously recognized as a unique clinical entity (Chi
et al., 2013).
Through comparison of the methylation profiles of 636 glioma
and 110 non-neoplastic normal samples from different tissue
types, we defined EReg signatures consisting of 27 genes that
showed differential signals among IDH-wild-type subtypes in
the TCGA (Figure 4D) and the validation set (Figure 4E). EReg4
comprised a group of 15 genes hypermethylated and downregulated in particularly Classic-like. EReg5 was defined as a group
of 12 genes associated with hypomethylation in LGm6/PA-like
compared to all other LGm clusters. These ERegs aided in characterizing the biological importance of IDH-wild-type subtypes
and were subsequently used to evaluate the prognostic importance of the IDH-wild-type clusters.
The Epigenetic Classification of Glioma Provides
Prognostic Value Independent of Age and Grade
In order to assess whether the DNA methylation-based subtypes
we identified carry prognostically relevant information independent of known overall survival predictors, we constructed a series of survival regression models. To find the optimal model
for survival prediction, we studied covariates individually and in
combination with other covariates. Age at diagnosis, histology,
IDH/codel subtype, TERT expression, and epigenetic subtype
all contribute to survival in single-predictor analysis (log-rank p
value < 0.05, Table S4). As expected, age was a highly significant
predictor (p < 0.0001, C-Index 0.78) and was included in all subsequent multi-predictor models. We found that histology and
grade are highly correlated. Histology provided only marginal
improvement to a model that includes grade (likelihood ratio
test [LRT] p value = 0.08) and was therefore not included in
further analyses. Conversely, grade markedly impacted a histology-based predictor model (LRT p value = 0.0005, Table S4) and
was retained in the subsequent models. In contrast to previous
reports (Eckel-Passow et al., 2015), we failed to observe a statistically significant and independent survival association with
TERT expression (LRT p value = 0.82, Table S4) or TERTp mutations after accounting for age and grade (LRT p value = 0.85,
data not shown). Thus, the optimal survival prediction model includes age, grade, and epigenetic subtype (LRT p value <
0.0001, C-Index 0.836; Table 2).
To confirm that the epigenetic subtypes provide independent
prognostic information, we tested the survival model on the
validation dataset. Epigenetic subtypes in these samples
were determined as described above. The distinction between
LGm6-GBM and PA-like gliomas was made on the basis of tumor grade and not by DNA methylation signature. Using a subset
of 183 samples in the validation cohort with known survival, age,
and grade, we found that epigenetic subtypes are significant independent predictors of survival in the multivariate analysis (LRT
p value < 0.0001, C-Index 0.746, Table 2). This generalization of
our model supports the epigenetic subtypes as a means to
improve the prognostication of glioma.
Activation of Cell Cycle/Proliferation and Invasion/
Microenvironmental Changes Marks Progression of
LGG to GBM
We observed that, in spite of morphological differences between
LGG and GBM, such as high cell density and microvascular proliferation, clustering of gene expression profiles frequently
grouped LGG and GBM together within the same subtype.
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of the genes activated in GCIMP GBM as opposed to the IDH mutant-non-codel within
LGr3 (Figure 2B) revealed four major groups, including cell cycle
and hyperproliferation, DNA metabolic processes, response to
stress, and angiogenesis (Figure S5A and Table S5). These biological functions are consistent with the criteria based on mitotic
index used by pathologists to discriminate lower and high-grade
glioma and the significance of activated microglia for tumor

aggressiveness (Roggendorf et al., 1996). Conversely, compared with the G-CIMP GBM, IDH mutant-non-codel LGG in
LGr3 were characterized by enrichment of genes associated
with neuro-glial functions such as ion transport and synaptic
transmission, possibly suggesting a more differentiated nature.
The comparison of co-clustered GBM and LGG in LGr3 by the
PARADIGM algorithm that integrates DNA copy number and
gene expression to infer pathway activity confirmed that
GBMs express genes associated with cell cycle, proliferation,
and aggressive phenotype through activation of a number of
cell cycle, cell replication, and NOTCH signaling pathways
whereas LGGs exhibit an enrichment of neuronal-differentiation-specific categories, including synaptic pathways (Figure S5C and Table S5).
The analysis of the genes activated in GBM versus the LGG
component of LGr4, which grouped IDH-wild-type tumors, identified an inflammation and immunologic response signature
characterized by the activation of several chemokines (CCL18,
CXCL13, CXCL2, and CXCL3) and interleukins (IL8 and
CXCR2) enriching sets involved in inflammatory and immune
response, negative regulation of apoptosis, cell cycle and proliferation, and the IKB/NFKB kinase cascade Map (Figure S5B and
Table S5). These characteristics suggest differences in the relative amount of microglia. We used the ESTIMATE method to estimate the relative presence of stromal cells, which revealed
significantly lower (p value 106) stromal scores of LGG IDHwild-type versus GBM IDH-wild-type (Figure S5F) (Yoshihara
et al., 2013). Resembling the functional enrichment for LGG
within LGr3, functional enrichment of LGG IDH-wild-type in comparison to GBM within LGr4 showed activation in LGG of special
glial-neuronal functions involved in ion transport, synaptic transmission, and nervous system development.
Finally, we aimed to identify transcription factors that may
exert control over prominent gene expression programs, known
as master regulators. Master regulator analysis comparing the
IDH-wild-type group to the IDH mutant group revealed transcription factors that were upregulated in IDH-wild-type gliomas and
showed an increase in expression of target genes, including
NKX2-5, FOSL1, ETV4, ETV7, RUNX1, CEBPD, NFE2L3, ELF4,
RUNX3, NR2F2, PAX8, and IRF1 (Table S5). No transcription factors (TFs) were found to be upregulated in IDH mutant gliomas
relative to IDH-wild-type gliomas (at a log fold change > 1).
DISCUSSION
This study represents the largest multi-platform genomic analysis performed to date of adult diffuse glioma (WHO grades II,
III, and IV). A simplified graphical summary of the identified
groups and their main clinical and biological characteristics is reported in Figure 5. The clustering of all diffuse glioma classes and
grades within similarly shaped methylation-based and expression-based groups has allowed us to pinpoint specific molecular
signatures with clinical relevance. The DNA methylation classification proposed should be considered as a basis and it is likely
that future studies involving significantly larger cohorts and more
refined profiling methods will be able to further reduce intra-subtype heterogeneity. The dissection of the IDH mutant non-codel
G-CIMP LGG and GBM into two separate subgroups (G-CIMPlow and G-CIMP-high) based on the extent of genome-wide DNA
methylation has crucial biological and clinical relevance. In
particular, the identification of the G-CIMP-low subset, characterized by activation of cell cycle genes mediated by SOX binding at hypomethylated functional genomic elements and unfavorable clinical outcome, is an important finding that will guide
more accurate segregation and therapeutic assessment in a
group of patients in which correlations of conventional grading
with outcome are modest (Olar et al., 2015; Reuss et al., 2015).
The finding that G-CIMP-high tumors can emerge as G-CIMPlow glioma at recurrence identifies variations in DNA methylation
as crucial determinants for glioma progression and provides a
clue to the mechanisms driving evolution of glioma. Our results
unify previous observations that linked the cell cycle pathway
to malignant progression of low-grade glioma (Mazor et al.,
2015). Future updates of the TCGA glioma clinical annotation
and independent validation of our findings may be able to
consider additionally important clinical confounders such as
extent of resection and performance status to further optimize
the weights of the currently known prognostic variables and their
association to the molecular subtypes we identified.
Analysis of IDH-wild-type glioma revealed the PA-like LGG
subset that harbors a silent genomic landscape, confers favorable prognosis relative to other IDH-wild-type diffuse glioma,
and displays a molecular profile with high similarity to PA. Re-review by neuropathologists and neuroradiologists confirmed that
the majority were correctly diagnosed as diffuse glioma, emphasizing the need for integration of molecular signatures intro clinical classification (Chi et al., 2013) for this subgroup of patients
that may be spared potentially unnecessary intensive
treatments.
The large number of exomes in our dataset allowed identification of novel glioma-associated somatic alterations, including in
the KRAS and NRAS genes, which were frequently used in
genetically engineered glioma mouse models (Holland et al.,
2000). Our analysis further nominates glial tumors to join an
increasing number of tumor types characterized by a deactivated cohesin pathway (Kon et al., 2013; Solomon et al., 2011).
Cohesin mutant tumors may infer increased sensitivity to DNA
damage agents and PARP inhibitors (Bailey et al., 2014),
suggesting that gliomas with genetic alterations of key cohesin
regulatory factors may represent biomarkers and therapeutic
opportunities.
Overexpression of TERT mRNA was found to be associated
with increased telomere length in urothelial cancer (Borah
et al., 2015). Our results revealed that, in gliomas, increased telomere length is associated with ATRX mutations, suggesting an
alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism. ALT has
been associated with sensitivity to inhibition of the protein kinase
ATR (Flynn et al., 2015).
In summary, our pan-glioma analysis has expanded our
knowledge of the glioma somatic alteration landscape, emphasized the relevance of DNA methylation profiles as a modality
for clinical classification, and quantitatively linked somatic
TERT pathway alterations to telomere maintenance. Combined,
these findings are an important step forward in our understanding of glioma as discrete disease subsets and the mechanisms
driving gliomagenesis.

Figure 5. Overview of Major Subtypes of Adult Diffuse Glioma
Integrative analysis of 1,122 adult gliomas resulted in 7 different subtypes with distinct biological and clinical characteristics. The groups extend across six DNA
methylation subtypes of which the LGm6 cluster was further separated by tumor grade into PA-like and LGm6-GBM. The size of the circles is proportional to the
percentages of samples within each group. DNA methylation plot is a cartoon representation of overall genome-wide epigenetic pattern within glioma subtypes.
Survival information is represented as a set of Kaplan-Meier curves, counts of grade, histology and LGG/GBM subtypes within the groups are represented as barplots, whereas age is represented as density. Labeling of telomere length and maintenance status is based on the enrichment of samples within each column,
similarly for the biomarkers and the validation datasets.
